Memo Notes Week One
Joseph Brower

(Assuming this will not have to be the cleanest notes as it is memos, can do this differently for different weeks if required. For now will be mix of bullet and point form.)

Set up the Git repo on monday (today), I have used Git so no issues there and will throw this in there at the end of the week. May have missed this in the week one stuff but I am assuming stuff if due at the end of the week on Sunday.

I have not used Jupyter before, maybe once but not much. Going to take some getting used to, I am mostly a Vim person. Took a bit to just explore the UI and look around, feel more than comfortable using this for notes.

Looking forward to this course as I like exploring other areas, I am not a archaeology or anthropology student but I always like seeing how other things can relate back to my studies in cognitive science even if they may seem unrelated.

I seem to be fully set up, I did not encounter any errors or new commands during setup, other than forgetting the password to my other Git account. I did encounter some errors while exporing jupyter, I set up auto backups to network storage for my notes as I am writing them so I dont lose them or mess something up on these and Jupyter did not seem to like when the files were backing up but have a solution sorted out so all is good now. 

I will come back and look at the podcast and readings then make those notes here before the reflection.


Podcast Notes:

I prefer the podcast style over zoom, nobody really interacts anyway so atleast I can download this and watch it in parts or go outside and listen

Reading Notes:
Cant open the second article, says Carleton Uni does not have acsess to this.

Article 1:
Havnt seen the term "skeuomorphic submission"

I really like the author's idea of the uncanny. 
An affective, unsettling response that emerges when digital reconstructions/simulations disturb expected boundaries between real and virtual, or between past and present.

From my understanding an analogy could be a ai generated voice of a person you know, it sounds like them but something is still off.

what produces this effect:
Highly realistic visualizations or immersive reconstructions that look/feel alive but lack the full contextual, material, or ethical grounding of the original.

I really like the autor's look on digital artifacts being material atrifacts and being treated as such.



Article 3:

Digital archeology is hard to catagorize

Sometimes seen as just tools sometimes as a whole paradigm shift

A need for divercity in the field

community projects are vital

Is it a tool, a paradigm shift, a specialized subfield, or pervasive across all archaeology?

how digital practices intersect with colonialism, equity, training, and collaboration in Canadian archaeology.

Article 4:

A continuum with four levels of digital engagement:

Publicity / Information

Dissemination only (websites, email lists, social media posts).

Mostly one-way communication

Participation / Contribution

Public can do tasks (liking, commenting, crowdsourcing, citizen science).

Example: Zooniverse, Portable Antiquities Scheme, MicroPasts

Users engage but donâ€™t shape project design

Collaboration

Shared dialogue, negotiation, and inclusion of community knowledge.

Communities have some say in project goals and design

Still, professionals usually make final decisions

Co-Creation

Power truly shared between archaeologists and communities

New resources or knowledge are created together, reflecting both professional and community needs

Example: community content management systems, Indigenous digital heritage platforms


Co-creation complicates models like Open Access: its not just about sharing data, but about sharing authority

Evaluation is essential: archaeologists must measure success of digital engagement, not just assume it

Best practice = adopt co-creative principles where possible (dialogue, shared goals, responsiveness), but recognize not all projects need to be fully co-created
